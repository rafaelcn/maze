# Maze

An implementation of a maze game in C using OpenGL as a final assignment. You 
can describe a maze to be loaded using the `assets/maze.txt` file and then
reload it into the program using the `r` keyword.

# Collision detection

The collision detection used in this game is poorly written and it doesn't 
work correctly as I wanted to do so.
